# Microsoft-Azure-Fundamentals
I will be studying about Azure Fundamentals by Microsoft and updating daily about my progress and understanding. I will be following SK Singh for Cloud Computing and Andrew Brown for Microsoft Azure Fundamentals.

## Day 1 of #Microsoft Azure Fundamentals
- **Course**: **Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900)** <br>

Today I learned what Cloud Computing  is, common terminology, and common components and a little bit of history before the rise of Cloud.<br>

It is the practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the Intenet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer.<br>

### Evolution to Cloud Hosting

#### Dedicated Server
