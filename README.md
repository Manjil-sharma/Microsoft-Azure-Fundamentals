# Microsoft-Azure-Fundamentals
I will be studying about Azure Fundamentals by Microsoft and updating daily about my progress and understanding. I will be following SK Singh for Cloud Computing and Andrew Brown for Microsoft Azure Fundamentals.

## Day 1 of #Microsoft Azure Fundamentals
:large_blue_diamond: **Course**: **Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900)** <br>

Today I learned what Cloud Computing  is, common terminology, and common components and a little bit of history before the rise of Cloud.<br>

### Cloud Computing
It is the practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the Intenet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer.<br>

### Evolution to Cloud Hosting

#### Dedicated Server
- Dedicated servers are one physical machine dedicated to a single business.<br>
- It only runs single web-app/site.
- It is very expensive and need high maintenancec but has high security.
- But every time we need a new business app/site, We need a new physical server.
- Since only one app/site uses the entire server the resources of the server will not be fully utalized.

### Virtual Private Server
- The Virtual Private Server is also a physical machine dedicated to a single business but the Physical machine is virtualized into sub-machines.
- Due to virtulization multiple web-apps/sites can run on single server.
- Hypervisor is placed on top of the Host Operating System due to which many virtual machines can be created .
- Those VM's runs independently and can runs different Operating System in different VM's.
- By the use of virtualization the resources can be more utalized then Dedicated server.

### Shared Hosting
- In Shared Hosting one physical machine is shared by hundred of business organization.
- It is very cheap but with some limitations.
- Relies on most tenants under-utilizing their resources. It means that if one person is using more resources then other the all other will be affected by it.

### Cloud Hosting
- In Cloud Hosting multiple physical machine act as one system which could be described as a cloud.
- The system is abstracted into multiple cloud services.
- It's flexible, Stable, Secure, Cost-effective and comes with high Configurability.
